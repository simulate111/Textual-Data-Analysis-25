At this point, it is impossible to promise that the pass will come or when it will come,\" Prime Minister  Sanna Marin  (SDP) told the media following the conclusion of the meeting. \\n \"The government has given the green light to the Covid pass and preparations will continue,\" Marin added. \\n Minister of Economic Affairs  Mika Lintilä  (Cen) told reporters immediately after the meeting that there was broad agreement between the coalition parties over the need for the certificate. \\n \"It [the pass] is an important tool so that we will not need restrictions any more,\" Lintilä said. \\n The government also decided at Thursday afternoon's meeting to offer coronavirus vaccines to all 12- to 15-year-olds, starting as early as next week. \\n \"Fortunately, we have received an extra batch of approximately 200,000 doses of vaccine in Finland, from which these vaccinations [for 12- to 15-year-olds] can be started without interfering with other vaccination programmes,\" Marin told Yle's A-studio on Wednesday evening. \\n Restrictions for bars, restaurants in spreading regions \\n Furthermore, the government will reintroduce restrictions on the opening hours and operations of bars and restaurants due to the deteriorating coronavirus situation in regions considered to be in the spreading — or most serious — phase of the epidemic. \\n This means that bars and restaurants in the regions of Southwest Finland, Pirkanmaa and Kymenlaakso, as well as the Helsinki metropolitan area, will have to adapt to new regulations that are due to take effect from Sunday. \\n The measures include the opening hours of bars being limited to between 7am and 10pm, while restaurants can stay open one hour later. A ban on karaoke and dancing indoors has also been reintroduced. \\n There will be no changes to the opening hours of bars or restaurants in regions considered to be in the acceleration phase of the pandemic. \\n Changes to external border traffic \\n The government has also decided to make changes to the restrictions on Finland's external border traffic, according to the Ministry of the Interior. External border traffic refers to traffic between Finland and countries not belonging to the Schengen area. \\n The regulations currently in effect will be amended, beginning from 9 August, so that entry restrictions are removed for Ukrainian residents traveling to Finland from Ukraine. \\n Restrictions on entry will be restored for residents of Azerbaijan, South Korea, Japan, Moldova, Serbia and Singapore travelling from these countries to Finland. \\n If a person arriving from the above-mentioned countries has not received a full series of vaccinations, the permitted entry criteria are a resident returning to Finland or other EU or Schengen countries, transit of regular scheduled flight traffic at the airport, or other essential reasons. \\n A person can travel to Finland from any country by presenting an acceptable certificate of the full vaccination series. \\n These new regulations aside, the restrictions that entered into force on 19 July still apply. \\n The latest restrictions are in effect until 22 August. \\n Protesters demand \"same rules for all\" \\n A small but vocal group of protestors, representing cultural sector workers, gathered near the House of the Estates while the government meeting was ongoing to demonstrate against coronavirus restrictions, demanding a fairer distribution of measures. \\n Restrictions have hit especially hard on the cultural and event industry, with many workers in the sector unable to work for the past year and a half. At the same time, the protestors pointed out, shopping malls have been allowed to operate as normal. \\n \"Same rules for all,\" the protesters chanted.   \n",

                                                               Rental fees for non-subsidised apartments rose across most of Finland during April to June, compared to the same period a year ago, according to data from Statistics Finland. \\n On average, rents rose by 0.9 percent during that period across the country. \\n Timo Metsola , board chair of rental agency Vuokraturva, attributed the increase to growing demand, saying that competition clearly intensified for the most desirable properties. \\n The sharpest rise in apartment rents during the April-June period was seen in the city of Turku, where costs rose by 1.6 percent, with the city of Tampere seeing an increase of 1.4 percent. \\n Meanwhile in the Greater Helsinki area, rents ticked up by 0.9 percent. \\n Among the country's municipal centres, the town of Mikkeli was the only area which saw rental fees decline. \\n Still priciest in Helsinki area \\n The number-crunching agency reported that the median rent for a studio apartment in central Helsinki was 809 euros per month, while they stood at 583 euros in downtown Tampere and 515 euros in the centre of Oulu. \\n Meanwhile, larger homes, for example three-room apartments cost a median of 1,634 in downtown Helsinki, 1,070 euros in Tampere and 940 euros in Oulu. \\n Metsola said that new students began searching for places to live towards the end of July, but noted that there were fewer young flat hunters this summer than in years before the coronavirus crisis. \\n \"The pandemic has increased distance learning, and only some educational institutions are planning to conduct in-person teaching when the academic year gets started this autumn,\" he said, explaining that fewer new students will start renting, compared to pre-crisis years.   \n",

Both the role and workload of the commission have grown exponentially in recent years, which is a good thing because athletes are the most important part of the Games,\" the 39-year-old Terho said in an Olympic Committee press release. \\n \"That is why it is both a great and huge responsibility to be in this role and also to continue Peter's legacy. I also believe that this is a valuable post and an opportunity to bring forward the values that I consider important as a Finn,\" she added. \\n Terho has been involved in the Athletes' Commission and the IOC since the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.   \n",

most serious — phase of the epidemic on 4 August. \\n The new measures mostly affect how many people can attend public and private events in the region, with organisers responsible for ensuring that

              "4  A small percentage of Finland's healthcare workers are yet to receive a coronavirus vaccine, an Yle survey has revealed. \\n This means that unvaccinated carers are currently tending to elderly patients in some care homes across the country, despite a law outlining that the use of vaccinated staff is prioritised when it comes to the treatment of vulnerable groups. \\n However, unlike with influenza, the Communicable Diseases Act does not require healthcare staff to get the coronavirus vaccine. \\n Yle emailed a questionnaire enquiring into the vaccination status of staff at all 20 hospital districts. Replies were received from 13 districts, and the survey found that between 85 and 95 percent of doctors and nurses have been vaccinated with at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \\n The figure is however just an estimate as precise health information is covered by patient confidentiality, even in the case of healthcare workers. The hospital district estimates were based on voluntary reports. \\n The Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS), for example, reported that the capital's caregivers' vaccination coverage is estimated at 95 percent, with that figure expected to rise. \\n \"Our goal is more than 95 percent vaccination coverage,\" HUS Communications Manager  Niina Kauppinen  said. \\n Unvaccinated younger workers causing concern \\n Although the number of unvaccinated staff is low and is most commonly detected among younger workers, the issue is causing concern for the Kymenlaakso Hospital District, or Kymsote, according to Chief Administrative Officer  Kari Kristeri . \\n \"They are [typically] socially active young adults who get the virus from trips and gatherings,\" Kristeri said. \\n Risto Pietikäinen , Kymsote's chief physician, said that although some of the workers tend to patients in their homes, chains of infections among the elderly population have been rare. \\n The infectious diseases specialist added that young people have found themselves at the tail of vaccination queues in the care sector so not everyone has yet had the chance to receive a jab. \\n What makes the situation worrying is that a surprising number of healthcare workers are turning the jab down, Pietikäinen added. \\n \"Some young people do not consider the vaccine necessary. I would imagine that some of the unvaccinated workers are still studying and are working for us on summer contracts,\" Pietikäinen said. \\n Up to a quarter of Lapland's healthcare staff unvaccinated \\n Markku Broas , chief physician in Lapland's Hospital District, said that nurses have been requested to take the vaccine only after severe outbreaks of infections. This has recently been the case in three care homes in Lapland and a ward unit of a healthcare centre. \\n \"Some 10-25 percent of staff on the wards were unvaccinated,\" Broas said, adding that this is not just solely due to a lack of willingness to get the jab. \\n Lapland's vaccination coverage has experienced delays and thus a large number of students working in hospitals and the care sector under summer contracts have not yet had the chance to get vaccinated or have only received one jab. \\n In Rovaniemi, for example, there have been difficulties in securing a vaccination appointment, and the vaccination of young people working in the social services was not prioritised over other members of the same age group. \\n \"New employees have not necessarily even had time to book the vaccine before starting work. It is only recently that the pace of vaccination of young people has started to pick up again,\" Broas said. \\n Some hospital districts prioritised vaccinations of staff members \\n The vaccine coverage of healthcare staff varies across different parts of Finland, according to the results of Yle's survey, with nurses and physicians in some districts having had quick and easy access to vaccinations. \\n This has also applied to deputies and summer workers.  Veikko Karvanen , Chief Physician of primary health care in Soster, the South-Savo Hospital District, reported that summer workers and deputies were able to receive their jabs as early as spring, before beginning their employment. \\n Finland's vaccination policy only gave priority to staff treating coronavirus patients and emergency care, but not all caregivers. \\n South Karelia's Hospital District (Eksote) and North Karelia's (Siun sote) reported that all workers who agreed to the jab have already been vaccinated. \\n In the North-Savo hospital district, summer workers have been able to receive the vaccine via occupational health care. \\n \"The mask recommendations have been valid for us all the time, so according to the employer's instructions, working with patients must be done in a protected manner, regardless of whether the employee has been vaccinated or not,\"  Anne Kantanen , director of nursing reported. \\n Kantanen also pointed out that the vaccine does not provide full protection and thus some of the vaccinated staff have also become infected. \\n \"Individual cases of infections in nurse staff have also been recorded, but there is no information on whether they have been vaccinated or not,\" Kantanen said.   \n",

              "      <td>Finland's government is pushing ahead with plans to introduce a Covid pass, following a meeting of ministers at the House of the Estates in Helsinki on Thursday afternoon. \\n \"There are still many open questions that need to be answered. At this point, it is impossible to promise that the pass will come or when it will come,\" Prime Minister  Sanna Marin  (SDP) told the media following the conclusion of the meeting. \\n \"The government has given the green light to the Covid pass and preparations will continue,\" Marin added. \\n Minister of Economic Affairs  Mika Lintilä  (Cen) told reporters immediately after the meeting that there was broad agreement between the coalition parties over the need for the certificate. \\n \"It [the pass] is an important tool so that we will not need restrictions any more,\" Lintilä said. \\n The government also decided at Thursday afternoon's meeting to offer coronavirus vaccines to all 12- to 15-year-olds, starting as early as next week. \\n \"Fortunately, we have received an extra batch of approximately 200,000 doses of vaccine in Finland, from which these vaccinations [for 12- to 15-year-olds] can be started without interfering with other vaccination programmes,\" Marin told Yle's A-studio on Wednesday evening. \\n Restrictions for bars, restaurants in spreading regions \\n Furthermore, the government will reintroduce restrictions on the opening hours and operations of bars and restaurants due to the deteriorating coronavirus situation in regions considered to be in the spreading — or most serious — phase of the epidemic. \\n This means that bars and restaurants in the regions of Southwest Finland, Pirkanmaa and Kymenlaakso, as well as the Helsinki metropolitan area, will have to adapt to new regulations that are due to take effect from Sunday. \\n The measures include the opening hours of bars being limited to between 7am and 10pm, while restaurants can stay open one hour later. A ban on karaoke and dancing indoors has also been reintroduced. \\n There will be no changes to the opening hours of bars or restaurants in regions considered to be in the acceleration phase of the pandemic. \\n Changes to external border traffic \\n The government has also decided to make changes to the restrictions on Finland's external border traffic, according to the Ministry of the Interior. External border traffic refers to traffic between Finland and countries not belonging to the Schengen area. \\n The regulations currently in effect will be amended, beginning from 9 August, so that entry restrictions are removed for Ukrainian residents traveling to Finland from Ukraine. \\n Restrictions on entry will be restored for residents of Azerbaijan, South Korea, Japan, Moldova, Serbia and Singapore travelling from these countries to Finland. \\n If a person arriving from the above-mentioned countries has not received a full series of vaccinations, the permitted entry criteria are a resident returning to Finland or other EU or Schengen countries, transit of regular scheduled flight traffic at the airport, or other essential reasons. \\n A person can travel to Finland from any country by presenting an acceptable certificate of the full vaccination series. \\n These new regulations aside, the restrictions that entered into force on 19 July still apply. \\n The latest restrictions are in effect until 22 August. \\n Protesters demand \"same rules for all\" \\n A small but vocal group of protestors, representing cultural sector workers, gathered near the House of the Estates while the government meeting was ongoing to demonstrate against coronavirus restrictions, demanding a fairer distribution of measures. \\n Restrictions have hit especially hard on the cultural and event industry, with many workers in the sector unable to work for the past year and a half. At the same time, the protestors pointed out, shopping malls have been allowed to operate as normal. \\n \"Same rules for all,\" the protesters chanted.</td>\n",

              "      <td>A small percentage of Finland's healthcare workers are yet to receive a coronavirus vaccine, an Yle survey has revealed. \\n This means that unvaccinated carers are currently tending to elderly patients in some care homes across the country, despite a law outlining that the use of vaccinated staff is prioritised when it comes to the treatment of vulnerable groups. \\n However, unlike with influenza, the Communicable Diseases Act does not require healthcare staff to get the coronavirus vaccine. \\n Yle emailed a questionnaire enquiring into the vaccination status of staff at all 20 hospital districts. Replies were received from 13 districts, and the survey found that between 85 and 95 percent of doctors and nurses have been vaccinated with at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \\n The figure is however just an estimate as precise health information is covered by patient confidentiality, even in the case of healthcare workers. The hospital district estimates were based on voluntary reports. \\n The Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS), for example, reported that the capital's caregivers' vaccination coverage is estimated at 95 percent, with that figure expected to rise. \\n \"Our goal is more than 95 percent vaccination coverage,\" HUS Communications Manager  Niina Kauppinen  said. \\n Unvaccinated younger workers causing concern \\n Although the number of unvaccinated staff is low and is most commonly detected among younger workers, the issue is causing concern for the Kymenlaakso Hospital District, or Kymsote, according to Chief Administrative Officer  Kari Kristeri . \\n \"They are [typically] socially active young adults who get the virus from trips and gatherings,\" Kristeri said. \\n Risto Pietikäinen , Kymsote's chief physician, said that although some of the workers tend to patients in their homes, chains of infections among the elderly population have been rare. \\n The infectious diseases specialist added that young people have found themselves at the tail of vaccination queues in the care sector so not everyone has yet had the chance to receive a jab. \\n What makes the situation worrying is that a surprising number of healthcare workers are turning the jab down, Pietikäinen added. \\n \"Some young people do not consider the vaccine necessary. I would imagine that some of the unvaccinated workers are still studying and are working for us on summer contracts,\" Pietikäinen said. \\n Up to a quarter of Lapland's healthcare staff unvaccinated \\n Markku Broas , chief physician in Lapland's Hospital District, said that nurses have been requested to take the vaccine only after severe outbreaks of infections. This has recently been the case in three care homes in Lapland and a ward unit of a healthcare centre. \\n \"Some 10-25 percent of staff on the wards were unvaccinated,\" Broas said, adding that this is not just solely due to a lack of willingness to get the jab. \\n Lapland's vaccination coverage has experienced delays and thus a large number of students working in hospitals and the care sector under summer contracts have not yet had the chance to get vaccinated or have only received one jab. \\n In Rovaniemi, for example, there have been difficulties in securing a vaccination appointment, and the vaccination of young people working in the social services was not prioritised over other members of the same age group. \\n \"New employees have not necessarily even had time to book the vaccine before starting work. It is only recently that the pace of vaccination of young people has started to pick up again,\" Broas said. \\n Some hospital districts prioritised vaccinations of staff members \\n The vaccine coverage of healthcare staff varies across different parts of Finland, according to the results of Yle's survey, with nurses and physicians in some districts having had quick and easy access to vaccinations. \\n This has also applied to deputies and summer workers.  Veikko Karvanen , Chief Physician of primary health care in Soster, the South-Savo Hospital District, reported that summer workers and deputies were able to receive their jabs as early as spring, before beginning their employment. \\n Finland's vaccination policy only gave priority to staff treating coronavirus patients and emergency care, but not all caregivers. \\n South Karelia's Hospital District (Eksote) and North Karelia's (Siun sote) reported that all workers who agreed to the jab have already been vaccinated. \\n In the North-Savo hospital district, summer workers have been able to receive the vaccine via occupational health care. \\n \"The mask recommendations have been valid for us all the time, so according to the employer's instructions, working with patients must be done in a protected manner, regardless of whether the employee has been vaccinated or not,\"  Anne Kantanen , director of nursing reported. \\n Kantanen also pointed out that the vaccine does not provide full protection and thus some of the vaccinated staff have also become infected. \\n \"Individual cases of infections in nurse staff have also been recorded, but there is no information on whether they have been vaccinated or not,\" Kantanen said.</td>\n",

Replies were received from 13 districts, and the survey found that between 85 and 95 percent of doctors and nurses have been vaccinated with at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine. \\n The figure is however just an estimate as precise health information is covered by patient confidentiality, even in the case of healthcare workers. The hospital district estimates were based on voluntary reports. \\n The Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital District (HUS), for example, reported that the capital's caregivers' vaccination coverage is estimated at 95 percent, with that figure expected to rise. \\n \\\"Our goal is more than 95 percent vaccination coverage,\\\" HUS Communications Manager  Niina Kauppinen  said. \\n Unvaccinated younger workers causing concern \\n Although the number of unvaccinated staff is low and is most commonly detected among younger workers, the issue is causing concern for the Kymenlaakso Hospital District, or Kymsote, according to Chief Administrative Officer  Kari Kristeri . \\n \\\"They are [typically] socially active young adults who get the virus from trips and gatherings,\\\" Kristeri said. \\n Risto Pietik\\u00e4inen , Kymsote's chief physician, said that although some of the workers tend to patients in their homes, chains of infections among the elderly population have been rare. \\n The infectious diseases specialist added that young people have found themselves at the tail of vaccination queues in the care sector so not everyone has yet had the chance to receive a jab. \\n What makes the situation worrying is that a surprising number of healthcare workers are turning the jab down, Pietik\\u00e4inen added. \\n \\\"Some young people do not consider the vaccine necessary. I would imagine that some of the unvaccinated workers are still studying and are working for us on summer contracts,\\\" Pietik\\u00e4inen said. \\n Up to a quarter of Lapland's healthcare staff unvaccinated \\n Markku Broas , chief physician in Lapland's Hospital District, said that nurses have been requested to take the vaccine only after severe outbreaks of infections. This has recently been the case in three care homes in Lapland and a ward unit of a healthcare centre. \\n \\\"Some 10-25 percent of staff on the wards were unvaccinated,\\\" Broas said, adding that this is not just solely due to a lack of willingness to get the jab. \\n Lapland's vaccination coverage has experienced delays and thus a large number of students working in hospitals and the care sector under summer contracts have not yet had the chance to get vaccinated or have only received one jab. \\n In Rovaniemi, for example, there have been difficulties in securing a vaccination appointment, and the vaccination of young people working in the social services was not prioritised over other members of the same age group. \\n \\\"New employees have not necessarily even had time to book the vaccine before starting work. It is only recently that the pace of vaccination of young people has started to pick up again,\\\" Broas said. \\n Some hospital districts prioritised vaccinations of staff members \\n The vaccine coverage of healthcare staff varies across different parts of Finland, according to the results of Yle's survey, with nurses and physicians in some districts having had quick and easy access to vaccinations. \\n This has also applied to deputies and summer workers.  Veikko Karvanen , Chief Physician of primary health care in Soster, the South-Savo Hospital District, reported that summer workers and deputies were able to receive their jabs as early as spring, before beginning their employment. \\n Finland's vaccination policy only gave priority to staff treating coronavirus patients and emergency care, but not all caregivers. \\n South Karelia's Hospital District (Eksote) and North Karelia's (Siun sote) reported that all workers who agreed to the jab have already been vaccinated. \\n In the North-Savo hospital district, summer workers have been able to receive the vaccine via occupational health care. \\n \\\"The mask recommendations have been valid for us all the time, so according to the employer's instructions, working with patients must be done in a protected manner, regardless of whether the employee has been vaccinated or not,\\\"  Anne Kantanen , director of nursing reported. \\n Kantanen also pointed out that the vaccine does not provide full protection and thus some of the vaccinated staff have also become infected. \\n \\\"Individual cases of infections in nurse staff have also been recorded, but there is no information on whether they have been vaccinated or not,\\\" Kantanen said.\",\n          \"Double Olympic ice hockey bronze medallist  Emma Terho  has been elected chair of the International Olympic Committee Athletes\\u2019 Commission (IOC AC). \\n The Athletes' Commission is a majority elected body that serves as the mediator between athletes and the IOC. \\n Terho will replace swimming champion  Kirsty Coventry  from Zimbabwe as AC chair after being elected ahead of Russian two-time Olympic pole vault champion,  Yelena Isinbayeva . \\n Terho will be following in the footsteps of Finnish Olympian and former sailor  Peter Tallberg , who was involved in the Olympic movement for more than 40 years. \\n \\\"Finland's Peter Tallberg was among the most proactive members of the Athletes' Commission and ensured that the voices of athletes would play a bigger role in the IOC.

That's when people want to go in or near the water, and the risks of drowning increase,\" FSL's Executive Director  Kristiina Heinonen  told Yle in July. \\n According to FSL, some 100 to 150 people drown in accidents every year in Finland. Around a third of drownings occur while swimming, one third are water traffic accidents and another third are caused when people accidentally fall into water, Heinonen added. \\n This year saw an increase in drownings of swimmers.</td>\n",

Meanwhile, net sales increased by just over three percent to 404.3 million euros. \\n The volume of parcels that Posti delivered domestically and to the Baltic countries increased by 16 percent, with the growth prompted by an uptick in online shopping as the coronavirus crisis continued throughout the first half of this year. \\n However, the amount of mail Posti processed and delivered continued to decline, with a decrease of nine percent compared to the first half of 2020. \\n Although profits were up, in a revised outlook the firm said that this year's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) would be roughly the same as last year, which was around 186.5 million euros. \\n The company said its efforts at formulating an outlook were hampered by the ongoing Covid-19 situation, which it said has caused uncertainty. \\n Posti's president and CEO,  Turkka Kuusisto , said he was pleased with the results. \\n \"After a year of unexpected and significant changes in demand, the highest volume peaks seem to be smoothing over. However, the trend is still clear: parcel and logistics volumes continue to rise while demand for postal services keeps declining,\" he said in the firm's financial release.</td>\n",

Both the role and workload of the commission have grown exponentially in recent years, which is a good thing because athletes are the most important part of the Games,\\\" the 39-year-old Terho said in an Olympic Committee press release. \\n \\\"That is why it is both a great and huge responsibility to be in this role and also to continue Peter's legacy. I also believe that this is a valuable post and an opportunity to bring forward the values that I consider important as a Finn,\\\" she added. \\n Terho has been involved in the Athletes' Commission and the IOC since the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.\",\n          \"Police in Turku have launched a preliminary investigation into a mass brawl in the city's port area on Sunday evening. \\n Tabloid Ilta-Sanomat reported that a fight involving an estimated 20 people broke out in front of the Silja Line terminal at about 6.30pm. \\n Police said they have received one criminal report of a suspected assault related to the incident, but they are not currently aware of any serious injuries resulting from the fight. \\n Chief Inspector  Riikka Laaksonen  told Yle that the fight had ended by the time police arrived at the scene and most of the suspected participants had already left. \\n \\\"The investigation has only just started.
