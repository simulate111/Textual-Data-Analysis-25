In the second, a one-out homer by Blake Forsythe made it 2-0 in the Mets' favor.\\nPillar brought the Fisher Cats back within a run in the third inning on an RBI single, but the B-Mets answered with a three-run homer in the bottom of the frame to push the scored to 5-1.\\nThe teams traded runs again in the fifth, with Glenn's home run leading off the top of the inning. Bibens-Dirkx was responsible for the Mets run in the bottom of the inning to leave the score at 6-2 Binghamton through five.\\nThe Fisher Cats had one more rally in the eighth inning, scoring a run on a Pillar double and a Binghamton error. The rally ended when Mets reliever Jack Leathersich retired the potential tying run in Adam Loewen on a fly ball to left field.\\nBibens-Dirkx (1-2) took the loss, allowing six runs over 4.2 innings. Rafael Montero (2-0) earned the win for the Mets with five innings of work.\\nPillar led the Fisher Cats offense with two more hits.

(originally written in Kannada), translated in English by Malleshwari Baddela\\nRising prices of pulses and meat have impacted the poor significantly. Waste-pickers with little income are left to fend themselves against the high costs of food. Even within waste-pickers, the migrant community members (from other states) are worst off. They have no formal linkage with public distribution system- thus, nothing nutritious and filling left in their diet. Many of the children of migrant waste-pickers are identified with malnutrition and protein deficiency.\\nSeven years back, an experiment of growing oyster mushrooms to counter malnutrition and protein deficiency was done in Amravati district of Maharashtra. It didn\\u2019t succeed for many different reasons including the absence of relevant subsidies etc. The idea of countering malnutrition and protein deficiency by oyster mushroom cultivation stayed in the head of Nalini Shekar, founder of Hasiru Dala. She wanted to do something around it for a long time.\\nOyster mushroom cultivation is very easy to do. You don\\u2019t need much of physical space. Chaffed paddy straw, an empty packet \\u2013 cover: size 18 inches, and mushroom seeds is all what one needs. Chaffed paddy straw is easily available and is the leftover following harvest. Straws have to be chopped in three inch pieces, after that the straws have to be boiled for one hour. Once boiled, the water is to be drained off. Then straws are spread on a clean dry cloth and left for drying under shade for two hours. The straws will be still moist.\\nA layer of seeds is added in the packet. After that an inch of moist straws is placed. It is repeated for four to five times in the same packet. The packet should be tightly packed with very little air in it. The packet should have ten- fifteen holes. It can be kept in shade, anywhere in the house, at room temperature for twenty days. On twentieth or twenty first day, spores will start coming out. Little water is to be sprinkled twice daily after the twentieth day. Mushrooms will be ready to harvest within couple of days of sprinkling water. Cook those mushrooms and have it for countering malnutrition and protein deficiency.\\nThe suggestion of growing mushrooms was shared with wastepickers. Many of them are excited about it. The first training was conducted in horticulture department. Very few came as the location was very far and one had to take time out of work to go there. It was decided to host the training sessions in the vicinity of their residence. Last week a training programme for the cultivation of mushrooms was conducted in Akshaya Nagara and Kalkere Cross, Bengaluru \\u2013 where most of the wastepickers reside, with the participation of 58 wastepickers and their family members. More have shown interest, many more training sessions planned.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Step-by-step\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No\",\n          \"Yes\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Training\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes\",\n          \"No\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Explanation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2512,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The article does not present a clear sequence of ordered steps for completing a specific task.

Williams wrecked his Lamborghini at about 3am Saturday morning and proceeded to leave the scene, only to be arrested 2 hours later. Williams released the following statement.\\n\\\"I am grateful that no one was injured in the accident. The driver in front of me slammed on his brakes and I turned to the left and hopped the curb to avoid hitting him. I got his insurance information and my neighbor picked me up when my car wouldn't drive. I live right near where the accident occurred, so my neighbor dropped me off and I called a tow truck and took the scooter from my house to go meet the tow truck driver. The police officer, who I have met in the past in the neighborhood, saw me on the scooter and arrested me without performing any sobriety tests. I have always been an upstanding citizen and handled the situation the best way I know how. I apologize if I should have handled it a little bit differently.\\\"\\nThis statement does raise some questions, and not just about Williams behavior, but the situation in general.\\n- How fast was Williams going in order to not be able to brake properly?\\n- When did Williams drink in order to get the public intoxication charge?\\n- Was Williams intoxicated?\\n- Williams owns a Lamborghini AND a scooter?\\nLots of questions still to be asked about this, but it'll most likely get swept under the rug, because he's in the NFL, and he's a Dallas Cowboy.\",\n          \"In today\\u2019s NHL rumors rundown, Toronto Maple Leafs GM Kyle Dubas clarifies why he didn\\u2019t add a defenseman at this year\\u2019s NHL Trade Deadline, the Winnipeg Jets might be a big spender in free agency and defenseman Drew Doughty of the Los Angeles Kings talks his struggles with the team\\u2019s current rebuild. Finally, what is the NHL doing about the coronavirus concerns affecting sports, especially as the virus enters North America?\\nMaple Leafs Didn\\u2019t See a Long-Term Fix\\nAccording to an article on TSN, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas told The Athletic\\u2019s Pierre LeBrun the reason he didn\\u2019t do anything to his blue line at this year\\u2019s trade deadline was because he couldn\\u2019t find a long-term fix that would solve the team\\u2019s problems.\\nDubas wasn\\u2019t interested in rentals or short-term fixes when he believes their issue on defense is not a short-term problem. Dubas said he received calls about defenseman Tyson Barrie, but didn\\u2019t get what he needed back as part of the return. As a result, he didn\\u2019t move him and has risked losing him for nothing in free agency.\\nOf course, many will argue Dubas created his own problems in this area by signing so many expensive contracts at forward and that he\\u2019ll try to fix those problems by spending more over the summer as the salary cap increases.\\nRelated: Top 3 All-Time Capitals Goalies\\nJets to Spend Money In Free Agency?\\nSpeaking of cap increases, Mike McIntyre of the Winnipeg Free Press writes that the projected salary cap increase for next year will entice teams to spend a little more and one of those teams could be the Winnipeg Jets.\\nJets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff to go shopping with an extra $4-$6 million to spend and with the termination of Dustin Byfuglien\\u2019s contract likely during the summer, the Jets could have as much as $22 million in available funds. Obviously, the Jets have some internal housekeeping items to look after, such as re-signing Jack Roslovic, Mason Appleton, Jansen Harkins, and Sami Niku.\\nRelated: Winnipeg Jets Jersey History\\nDoughty Struggling With Kings Re-Build\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard, but it\\u2019s the position I\\u2019m in, and I gotta try to stay positive every day, as hard as it is,\\u201d Drew Doughty told TSN when asked about the Los Angeles Kings current rebuild, He likes the prospects in the pipeline, but Doughty says it\\u2019s often a struggle knowing where they were as a team not just a few short years ago.\\n\\u201cI have to make the best of it and just try to get better every day, both as a team and individually,\\u201d he added.\\nCoronavirus Update for the NHL\\nThere are many in the NHL starting to think the coronavirus issue is going to be a major issue that affects games, meetings and other events related to North American sports, including the NHL. So far, 36 events worldwide have been affected.\\nHealth officials had actually already requested that the San Jose Sharks cancel Thursday\\u2019s game and Sharks Sports and Entertainment issued a statement in which it said it was \\u201caware of the recommendations\\u201d made by the county, but that Thursday night\\u2019s game against the Minnesota Wild would \\u201cgo on as scheduled.\\u201d\\nCommissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL has barred League employees from overseas business travel and advised the media that those who make personal trips to affected countries must be quarantined out of the office for two weeks upon their return to see if symptoms arise.\\nRight now, the virus hasn\\u2019t hit the games yet, but the NHL is keeping an extremely close eye on things.\\nCatch up on all the latest NHL Rumors\",\n          \"Idea Crib\\u2019s Well-thy Pinoy Profiles blog series is now underway!! With this blog series, I plan to regularly feature healthy and happy Pinoys and glean insights about why and how they keep healthy and happy. The ultimate aim is to inspire more individuals to take care of themselves by taking care of their health and their bodies.\\nThe first featured personality in this blog series is my friend Carlo, a marathoner and Certified Investment Solicitor. He also just finished his first triathlon last week. Check out his answers in the blog\\u2019s latest post.\\nWell-thy Pinoy Profiles: Get to Know Carlo Sicat\\nOccupation Senior Financial Adviser & Certified Investment Solicitor\\nHobbies Triathlon, Ultimate Frisbee, and Backpack Traveling\\nSocial media profile IG: @carlokohan\\nHow do you stay healthy?\\nI stay healthy by making sure I do physical activities daily or every other day. I also make sure that I eat right and in moderation.\\nWhy do you keep healthy?\\nIt feels good to be healthy. It boosts your confidence and it also gives you benefits like not being sick and being able to function well in your job.\\nWhen did you decide to live healthy?\\nI used to work in the BPO Industry. As we all know, the nature of BPO work is kind of exhausting due to shifting schedules; I gained a lot of weight while working in a BPO company.\\nI used to be a fan of fast food. I loved eating in buffet and indulging in sweets. I thought that as long as I was earning good, I can eat whatever I want. Until I frequently got sick. I remember getting hospitalized 3x a year due to gastritis. I was obese by then. I thought I was healthy because I looked healthy but I wasn\\u2019t. That was when I decided to lose weight.\\nI tried running thinking that was the fastest way to lose weight. It proved effective for me. I learned to love it and it eventually became part of my routine.\\nWhat are your favorite indulgences/ cheat day treats?\\nIce cream. I can finish a 1.5 gallon in one seating. My favorite flavor is cookies and cream. Buffets. I still can\\u2019t resist them. Tenka at Glorietta 4 is my favorite so far.\\nIn your opinion, what\\u2019s the one thing people can do to kick-start their journey to wellness?\\nDid you know that eating healthy, doing physical activities, and not smoking are the 3 easy behaviors we can do to not get sick? According to studies, if we take these for granted, these may lead to the top 4 chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and lung diseases which contribute to 50% of deaths world wide. You don\\u2019t have to be an athlete or a gym rat. Just make sure you stay active, eat healthy, and quit smoking (if you\\u2019re a smoker, that is) because the only person who will take care of the sick person you will be is the healthy you now.\\nI love that last line. Soo true. I also agree that you don\\u2019t have to be an athlete to be healthy! What can you say about Carlo\\u2019s journey to fitness and wellness? Who else can I feature in this series? I\\u2019d love to hear your comments below.\\nThe next Well-thy Pinoy Profile is on March 30, 2016.

CR7 granted another interview to UEFA.com this Thursday and underlined that Real Madrid should win the UEFA Champions League or the Spanish \"La Liga\" this year. The Portuguese player had a tremendous 2010-11 season, breaking several all-time records, but only managed to win one title, the \"Copa del Rey\" in Real Madrid's campaign last year.\n",

Ronaldo also insisted on praising his teammates and reckonizing how important they are for him to also put on good performances on the field, which allow him to keep making History and break several records.\n",
            "Cristiano Ronaldo: \"Being in a club as Real Madrid definately helps a lot. With so many good players around us, things can only go well, because we all support each other. This teams gives me guarantees that I can play at my best level and keep scoring goals that turn out to be important for Real Madrid.\"\n",

Ronaldo: \"I must confess that as a team, we still have to need an important and big trophy such as the UEFA Champions League or La Liga, because that is indeed, the result of success in this sport. The UEFA Champions League can be the biggest reward of a great season for a football player, since it's one of the most important titles and trophies in the World. I had the chance to win that trophy in 2008, while playing in Manchester United and that was the best moment of my football career so far. My wish these days is to repeat that accomplishment with Real Madrid in a near future.\"\n",
            "Even though Cristiano Ronaldo insistently speaks of winning big titles, CR7 is well aware of the need to have their feet on the ground and that they must look at competitions stage by stage, game after game: \"The Champions League group stage is very important and we'll give our best to overcome it and take the first place in the group. I think we have all the conditions we need for that to happen, because our group is indeed not the most difficult one.\" Real Madrid was drawn in UEFA Champions League Group D, with the following teams:\n",
