(originally written in Kannada), translated in English by Malleshwari Baddela\\nRising prices of pulses and meat have impacted the poor significantly. Waste-pickers with little income are left to fend themselves against the high costs of food. Even within waste-pickers, the migrant community members (from other states) are worst off. They have no formal linkage with public distribution system- thus, nothing nutritious and filling left in their diet. Many of the children of migrant waste-pickers are identified with malnutrition and protein deficiency.\\nSeven years back, an experiment of growing oyster mushrooms to counter malnutrition and protein deficiency was done in Amravati district of Maharashtra. It didn\\u2019t succeed for many different reasons including the absence of relevant subsidies etc. The idea of countering malnutrition and protein deficiency by oyster mushroom cultivation stayed in the head of Nalini Shekar, founder of Hasiru Dala. She wanted to do something around it for a long time.\\nOyster mushroom cultivation is very easy to do. You don\\u2019t need much of physical space. Chaffed paddy straw, an empty packet \\u2013 cover: size 18 inches, and mushroom seeds is all what one needs. Chaffed paddy straw is easily available and is the leftover following harvest. Straws have to be chopped in three inch pieces, after that the straws have to be boiled for one hour. Once boiled, the water is to be drained off. Then straws are spread on a clean dry cloth and left for drying under shade for two hours. The straws will be still moist.\\nA layer of seeds is added in the packet. After that an inch of moist straws is placed. It is repeated for four to five times in the same packet. The packet should be tightly packed with very little air in it. The packet should have ten- fifteen holes. It can be kept in shade, anywhere in the house, at room temperature for twenty days. On twentieth or twenty first day, spores will start coming out. Little water is to be sprinkled twice daily after the twentieth day. Mushrooms will be ready to harvest within couple of days of sprinkling water. Cook those mushrooms and have it for countering malnutrition and protein deficiency.\\nThe suggestion of growing mushrooms was shared with wastepickers. Many of them are excited about it. The first training was conducted in horticulture department. Very few came as the location was very far and one had to take time out of work to go there. It was decided to host the training sessions in the vicinity of their residence. Last week a training programme for the cultivation of mushrooms was conducted in Akshaya Nagara and Kalkere Cross, Bengaluru \\u2013 where most of the wastepickers reside, with the participation of 58 wastepickers and their family members. More have shown interest, many more training sessions planned.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Step-by-step\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No\",\n          \"Yes\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Training\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes\",\n          \"No\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Explanation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2512,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The article does not present a clear sequence of ordered steps for completing a specific task.

Williams wrecked his Lamborghini at about 3am Saturday morning and proceeded to leave the scene, only to be arrested 2 hours later. Williams released the following statement.\\n\\\"I am grateful that no one was injured in the accident. The driver in front of me slammed on his brakes and I turned to the left and hopped the curb to avoid hitting him. I got his insurance information and my neighbor picked me up when my car wouldn't drive. I live right near where the accident occurred, so my neighbor dropped me off and I called a tow truck and took the scooter from my house to go meet the tow truck driver. The police officer, who I have met in the past in the neighborhood, saw me on the scooter and arrested me without performing any sobriety tests. I have always been an upstanding citizen and handled the situation the best way I know how. I apologize if I should have handled it a little bit differently.\\\"\\nThis statement does raise some questions, and not just about Williams behavior, but the situation in general.\\n- How fast was Williams going in order to not be able to brake properly?\\n- When did Williams drink in order to get the public intoxication charge?\\n- Was Williams intoxicated?\\n- Williams owns a Lamborghini AND a scooter?\\nLots of questions still to be asked about this, but it'll most likely get swept under the rug, because he's in the NFL, and he's a Dallas Cowboy.\",\n          \"In today\\u2019s NHL rumors rundown, Toronto Maple Leafs GM Kyle Dubas clarifies why he didn\\u2019t add a defenseman at this year\\u2019s NHL Trade Deadline, the Winnipeg Jets might be a big spender in free agency and defenseman Drew Doughty of the Los Angeles Kings talks his struggles with the team\\u2019s current rebuild. Finally, what is the NHL doing about the coronavirus concerns affecting sports, especially as the virus enters North America?\\nMaple Leafs Didn\\u2019t See a Long-Term Fix\\nAccording to an article on TSN, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas told The Athletic\\u2019s Pierre LeBrun the reason he didn\\u2019t do anything to his blue line at this year\\u2019s trade deadline was because he couldn\\u2019t find a long-term fix that would solve the team\\u2019s problems.\\nDubas wasn\\u2019t interested in rentals or short-term fixes when he believes their issue on defense is not a short-term problem. Dubas said he received calls about defenseman Tyson Barrie, but didn\\u2019t get what he needed back as part of the return. As a result, he didn\\u2019t move him and has risked losing him for nothing in free agency.\\nOf course, many will argue Dubas created his own problems in this area by signing so many expensive contracts at forward and that he\\u2019ll try to fix those problems by spending more over the summer as the salary cap increases.\\nRelated: Top 3 All-Time Capitals Goalies\\nJets to Spend Money In Free Agency?\\nSpeaking of cap increases, Mike McIntyre of the Winnipeg Free Press writes that the projected salary cap increase for next year will entice teams to spend a little more and one of those teams could be the Winnipeg Jets.\\nJets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff to go shopping with an extra $4-$6 million to spend and with the termination of Dustin Byfuglien\\u2019s contract likely during the summer, the Jets could have as much as $22 million in available funds. Obviously, the Jets have some internal housekeeping items to look after, such as re-signing Jack Roslovic, Mason Appleton, Jansen Harkins, and Sami Niku.\\nRelated: Winnipeg Jets Jersey History\\nDoughty Struggling With Kings Re-Build\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard, but it\\u2019s the position I\\u2019m in, and I gotta try to stay positive every day, as hard as it is,\\u201d Drew Doughty told TSN when asked about the Los Angeles Kings current rebuild, He likes the prospects in the pipeline, but Doughty says it\\u2019s often a struggle knowing where they were as a team not just a few short years ago.\\n\\u201cI have to make the best of it and just try to get better every day, both as a team and individually,\\u201d he added.\\nCoronavirus Update for the NHL\\nThere are many in the NHL starting to think the coronavirus issue is going to be a major issue that affects games, meetings and other events related to North American sports, including the NHL. So far, 36 events worldwide have been affected.\\nHealth officials had actually already requested that the San Jose Sharks cancel Thursday\\u2019s game and Sharks Sports and Entertainment issued a statement in which it said it was \\u201caware of the recommendations\\u201d made by the county, but that Thursday night\\u2019s game against the Minnesota Wild would \\u201cgo on as scheduled.\\u201d\\nCommissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL has barred League employees from overseas business travel and advised the media that those who make personal trips to affected countries must be quarantined out of the office for two weeks upon their return to see if symptoms arise.\\nRight now, the virus hasn\\u2019t hit the games yet, but the NHL is keeping an extremely close eye on things.\\nCatch up on all the latest NHL Rumors\",\n          \"Idea Crib\\u2019s Well-thy Pinoy Profiles blog series is now underway!! With this blog series, I plan to regularly feature healthy and happy Pinoys and glean insights about why and how they keep healthy and happy. The ultimate aim is to inspire more individuals to take care of themselves by taking care of their health and their bodies.\\nThe first featured personality in this blog series is my friend Carlo, a marathoner and Certified Investment Solicitor. He also just finished his first triathlon last week. Check out his answers in the blog\\u2019s latest post.\\nWell-thy Pinoy Profiles: Get to Know Carlo Sicat\\nOccupation Senior Financial Adviser & Certified Investment Solicitor\\nHobbies Triathlon, Ultimate Frisbee, and Backpack Traveling\\nSocial media profile IG: @carlokohan\\nHow do you stay healthy?\\nI stay healthy by making sure I do physical activities daily or every other day. I also make sure that I eat right and in moderation.\\nWhy do you keep healthy?\\nIt feels good to be healthy. It boosts your confidence and it also gives you benefits like not being sick and being able to function well in your job.\\nWhen did you decide to live healthy?\\nI used to work in the BPO Industry. As we all know, the nature of BPO work is kind of exhausting due to shifting schedules; I gained a lot of weight while working in a BPO company.\\nI used to be a fan of fast food. I loved eating in buffet and indulging in sweets. I thought that as long as I was earning good, I can eat whatever I want. Until I frequently got sick. I remember getting hospitalized 3x a year due to gastritis. I was obese by then. I thought I was healthy because I looked healthy but I wasn\\u2019t. That was when I decided to lose weight.\\nI tried running thinking that was the fastest way to lose weight. It proved effective for me. I learned to love it and it eventually became part of my routine.\\nWhat are your favorite indulgences/ cheat day treats?\\nIce cream. I can finish a 1.5 gallon in one seating. My favorite flavor is cookies and cream. Buffets. I still can\\u2019t resist them. Tenka at Glorietta 4 is my favorite so far.\\nIn your opinion, what\\u2019s the one thing people can do to kick-start their journey to wellness?\\nDid you know that eating healthy, doing physical activities, and not smoking are the 3 easy behaviors we can do to not get sick? According to studies, if we take these for granted, these may lead to the top 4 chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and lung diseases which contribute to 50% of deaths world wide. You don\\u2019t have to be an athlete or a gym rat. Just make sure you stay active, eat healthy, and quit smoking (if you\\u2019re a smoker, that is) because the only person who will take care of the sick person you will be is the healthy you now.\\nI love that last line. Soo true. I also agree that you don\\u2019t have to be an athlete to be healthy! What can you say about Carlo\\u2019s journey to fitness and wellness? Who else can I feature in this series? I\\u2019d love to hear your comments below.\\nThe next Well-thy Pinoy Profile is on March 30, 2016.

I know that this is a type of publicity and not always my experience with the movie trailers (because these are the ones I see more) is not the best, but because of them I have a better idea about the movie. With the book trailers it doesn’t go the same, because I have more information about the novels in question before seeing the trailer, but from the all kinds of publicity I think that the trailers are the one I get along with best. The latest book trailer I saw is for the Stephen King’s novel, “Under the Dome”, released two days ago, on 10th of November and I have to admit that it is one of the best I’ve seen. I really like it and it is close with what I have in mind about this novel.

The nominations for this year David Gemmell Legend Award haven’t been announced yet, but exciting news came from the organizers. This year, besides the David Gemmell Legend Award for Fantasy, two more categories will be rewarded, “The Morningstar Award for Best Newcomer” and “The Ravenheart Award for Best Fantasy Cover Art”.\n",

            "The Ravenheart Award will honour the best fantasy book cover art. The importance of fantasy cover art deserves admiration, as do the artists who produce it, yet there is no major UK award acknowledging this. The Ravenheart Award will fulfil that role.\n",
            "I am excited about these two new categories, especially for The Ravenheart Award, since I love fantasy art and the artwork for book covers and I tried to promote it us much as possible here on my blog. The addition of these two categories is praiseworthy and it remains now only to see the nominations for this year awards.\n",

            "Document: Two articles caught my eye over the weekend, and got me rather worried about how traditional media and big business might be changing their approach to social media. While there have been encouraging noises made about the greater openness that social networking encourages, I wonder whether the former gatekeepers of information are quite as enthusiastic as they appear.\n",
            "The first, in my local paper, was a brief piece on how the largest law firm in the city is setting up a “Cyber Tracing team” to track down people making uncomplimentary comments about their clients online and, presumably, sue them for defamation and/or libel. The second, by Jon Henley in the Guardian, concerned the people power of social networks, specifically Twitter, and the speed with which a minor incident can become a frenzy.\n",
            "Now, Henley’s piece wasn’t overtly hostile, but I was left with the distinct impression from some of the quotes he cites that a number of people think social networking might actually be bad for freedom of speech. Essentially, people with controversial opinion or that rub against the liberal grain will be subject to the electronic equivalent of a baying mob, and will therefore hesitate before speaking out, if they speak out at all. Self-censorship can be as powerful as any editor’s blue pencil, and if the threat of being the subject of a Twitterstorm is enough to cow an individual into silence, that can be just as destructive to public discourse as the super-injunction that caused the #Trafigura conflagration.\n",
            "At the same time, freedom of speech is done a similar disservice if you have a team of lawyers whose main responsibility is to trawl chatrooms, blogs and forums, looking for anything that might hurt their client’s feelings. As Trafigura found out to their cost, sometimes trying to shut down debate can backfire spectacularly, leaving you embarrassed and the details of whatever you hoped to cover up exposed to a wider audience than if you had simply left well enough alone. Not only that, but any battle is likely to be asymmetric: on one side a battery of expensive lawyers with the full weight of the ludicrous defamation and libel laws of the UK behind them; on the other, a lone individual with nothing close to the same resources. And I don’t think you can get no-win-no-fee deals for libel defences.\n",
            "Reading the two articles on the same day, I was struck at how traditional media and companies who use the media seem to be of the mind that “something has to be done,” even as they make efforts of their own to engage with their audiences through social media. It’s almost as though, having lost the means of controlling the message, they would now rather exert some control over social media itself. The multitude of bloggers, forum members and tweeters is too immense, too fragmented to corral, so the implicit threat of legal action is used. The speed at which information can be disseminated means that traditional journalism can find itself playing catch-up, so Twitterstorms are dismissed as incoherent, messy, or simply well-meaning idiots succumbing to mob mentality.\n",
            "I don’t agree with either approach. Firstly, because suing somebody who writes something you disagree with is, in most cases, using the proverbial sledgehammer to crack a nut. Secondly, because bloggers and readers who also use social media are probably better-informed than some traditional journalists think. Yes, it can seem overwhelming when an item is trending, but people do have the choice as to whether or not to retweet, or even tweet at all. Aside from the spammers, nobody has an incentive to hitch their wagon to a topic. It is the ease with which views can be expressed that has changed, not the level of engagement. Whereas previously, public reaction to a particular newspaper article may have been gauged by the number of letters sent to the editor, today people can express their opinion wherever they like, and others can chime in to voice their agreement or disagreement, without having to set up a petition or letter-writing campaign.\n",
            "Change can be unsettling, and as the media landscape changes, there are bound to be more debates and arguments about the role and responsibilities of traditional media, social networks, and how people and businesses use them. While I don’t think that the internet is a free utopia where nothing bad ever happens, neither do I see it as a lawless Wild West where chaos reigns. Social networking is largely benign, provided you are willing to get involved. It’s those who are determined to keep a hands-off approach who are likely to face the biggest challenges.\n",

        "Classifier Effectiveness: The classifier performs reasonably well, with an F1 score of 0.6012, suggesting it is fairly effective at distinguishing between useful training data and non-relevant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Composition: The dataset contains documents that were manually labeled based on a model's prediction of whether they contain structured steps for task completion or reasoning. This curated nature of the dataset means that the results should be viewed with caution. If the dataset has biases or ambiguities, they will directly influence the classifier’s performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generalization to FineWeb: The classifier's performance on the test set might not fully generalize to the entire FineWeb dataset, as the model's predictions were based on the curated labels. The diversity of topics and document structures within the broader FineWeb could lead to performance drops. Therefore, while it may be reasonable to apply the classifier to the FineWeb data, the results should be carefully monitored, and further tuning or evaluation on a more representative dataset might be needed.\n",

        "Handling class imbalances through techniques like oversampling or class weighting.\n",
        "Fine-tuning the classifier on more varied data to improve generalization.\n",

        "By continuing to refine and adjust the model, its predictions on new documents can become more accurate and robust, ensuring its usefulness for real-world applications."

        "The dataset we used is derived from FineWeb, and the labels were generated by a GPT-4o-mini model, which was likely trained to identify \"step-by-step\" procedural documents and those that might aid in deeper reasoning. This means the composition of the dataset is already somewhat curated.\n",

        "Consequences for Results:\n",
        "Label Quality: The labels given by GPT-4o-mini serve as a gold standard, but they may not be perfect. Since the model was tasked with making binary judgments (Yes/No), there may be some ambiguity in documents that don’t clearly fit one category.\n",
        "Class Imbalance: The distribution of \"Yes\" and \"No\" for the \"Training\" and \"Step-by-step\" labels might not be balanced. If one category (e.g., \"Yes\") is underrepresented, the classifier might be biased toward predicting the majority class.\n",
        "Data Bias: Since GPT-4o-mini likely used pre-existing data patterns to decide on the labels, it might have biased the dataset towards certain types of procedural documents or reasoning-heavy articles. This could affect the generalization ability of the classifier."

        "This project aimed to train a classifier to detect documents containing step-by-step instructions useful for training reasoning models using a dataset of 2,515 web articles. The model used was based on BERT, fine-tuned on the \"Training\" label (Yes/No) of the dataset. The performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. After training, manual inspection of the model’s predictions revealed that while the model performed fairly well, certain challenges related to data quality and imbalances in labels impacted the results.\n",

        "Data Composition: The dataset was relatively balanced but still showed some bias, as documents flagged as \"Training: Yes\" are typically a subset of \"Step-by-step: Yes\". This overlap may have influenced the model’s evaluation.\n",

        "Challenges:\n",
        "\n",
        "The model occasionally confused documents that contain procedural instructions but might not have been detailed enough for deeper reasoning.\n",
        "The classification accuracy and other metrics may not fully reflect real-world usability, as the data is limited to a subset of \"step-by-step\" tasks and doesn't capture the full diversity of the FineWeb domain.\n",
        "Model's Potential: While the current model performs well on the training and validation data, applying this model on the entire FineWeb dataset could require more refinement to handle edge cases and documents with less clear instructions.\n",

        "Future Steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "Further fine-tuning with additional data to improve recall and precision.\n",
        "Addressing potential data imbalance and exploring more complex models (e.g., ensemble methods) could enhance the results.\n",
        "The project demonstrates that the classifier is useful for identifying well-structured instructional documents but would require more work to generalize across a broader set of web content."
