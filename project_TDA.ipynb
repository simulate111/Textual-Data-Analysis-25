In the second, a one-out homer by Blake Forsythe made it 2-0 in the Mets' favor.\\nPillar brought the Fisher Cats back within a run in the third inning on an RBI single, but the B-Mets answered with a three-run homer in the bottom of the frame to push the scored to 5-1.\\nThe teams traded runs again in the fifth, with Glenn's home run leading off the top of the inning. Bibens-Dirkx was responsible for the Mets run in the bottom of the inning to leave the score at 6-2 Binghamton through five.\\nThe Fisher Cats had one more rally in the eighth inning, scoring a run on a Pillar double and a Binghamton error. The rally ended when Mets reliever Jack Leathersich retired the potential tying run in Adam Loewen on a fly ball to left field.\\nBibens-Dirkx (1-2) took the loss, allowing six runs over 4.2 innings. Rafael Montero (2-0) earned the win for the Mets with five innings of work.\\nPillar led the Fisher Cats offense with two more hits.

(originally written in Kannada), translated in English by Malleshwari Baddela\\nRising prices of pulses and meat have impacted the poor significantly. Waste-pickers with little income are left to fend themselves against the high costs of food. Even within waste-pickers, the migrant community members (from other states) are worst off. They have no formal linkage with public distribution system- thus, nothing nutritious and filling left in their diet. Many of the children of migrant waste-pickers are identified with malnutrition and protein deficiency.\\nSeven years back, an experiment of growing oyster mushrooms to counter malnutrition and protein deficiency was done in Amravati district of Maharashtra. It didn\\u2019t succeed for many different reasons including the absence of relevant subsidies etc. The idea of countering malnutrition and protein deficiency by oyster mushroom cultivation stayed in the head of Nalini Shekar, founder of Hasiru Dala. She wanted to do something around it for a long time.\\nOyster mushroom cultivation is very easy to do. You don\\u2019t need much of physical space. Chaffed paddy straw, an empty packet \\u2013 cover: size 18 inches, and mushroom seeds is all what one needs. Chaffed paddy straw is easily available and is the leftover following harvest. Straws have to be chopped in three inch pieces, after that the straws have to be boiled for one hour. Once boiled, the water is to be drained off. Then straws are spread on a clean dry cloth and left for drying under shade for two hours. The straws will be still moist.\\nA layer of seeds is added in the packet. After that an inch of moist straws is placed. It is repeated for four to five times in the same packet. The packet should be tightly packed with very little air in it. The packet should have ten- fifteen holes. It can be kept in shade, anywhere in the house, at room temperature for twenty days. On twentieth or twenty first day, spores will start coming out. Little water is to be sprinkled twice daily after the twentieth day. Mushrooms will be ready to harvest within couple of days of sprinkling water. Cook those mushrooms and have it for countering malnutrition and protein deficiency.\\nThe suggestion of growing mushrooms was shared with wastepickers. Many of them are excited about it. The first training was conducted in horticulture department. Very few came as the location was very far and one had to take time out of work to go there. It was decided to host the training sessions in the vicinity of their residence. Last week a training programme for the cultivation of mushrooms was conducted in Akshaya Nagara and Kalkere Cross, Bengaluru \\u2013 where most of the wastepickers reside, with the participation of 58 wastepickers and their family members. More have shown interest, many more training sessions planned.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Step-by-step\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"No\",\n          \"Yes\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Training\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Yes\",\n          \"No\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Explanation\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2512,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"The article does not present a clear sequence of ordered steps for completing a specific task.

Williams wrecked his Lamborghini at about 3am Saturday morning and proceeded to leave the scene, only to be arrested 2 hours later. Williams released the following statement.\\n\\\"I am grateful that no one was injured in the accident. The driver in front of me slammed on his brakes and I turned to the left and hopped the curb to avoid hitting him. I got his insurance information and my neighbor picked me up when my car wouldn't drive. I live right near where the accident occurred, so my neighbor dropped me off and I called a tow truck and took the scooter from my house to go meet the tow truck driver. The police officer, who I have met in the past in the neighborhood, saw me on the scooter and arrested me without performing any sobriety tests. I have always been an upstanding citizen and handled the situation the best way I know how. I apologize if I should have handled it a little bit differently.\\\"\\nThis statement does raise some questions, and not just about Williams behavior, but the situation in general.\\n- How fast was Williams going in order to not be able to brake properly?\\n- When did Williams drink in order to get the public intoxication charge?\\n- Was Williams intoxicated?\\n- Williams owns a Lamborghini AND a scooter?\\nLots of questions still to be asked about this, but it'll most likely get swept under the rug, because he's in the NFL, and he's a Dallas Cowboy.\",\n          \"In today\\u2019s NHL rumors rundown, Toronto Maple Leafs GM Kyle Dubas clarifies why he didn\\u2019t add a defenseman at this year\\u2019s NHL Trade Deadline, the Winnipeg Jets might be a big spender in free agency and defenseman Drew Doughty of the Los Angeles Kings talks his struggles with the team\\u2019s current rebuild. Finally, what is the NHL doing about the coronavirus concerns affecting sports, especially as the virus enters North America?\\nMaple Leafs Didn\\u2019t See a Long-Term Fix\\nAccording to an article on TSN, Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Kyle Dubas told The Athletic\\u2019s Pierre LeBrun the reason he didn\\u2019t do anything to his blue line at this year\\u2019s trade deadline was because he couldn\\u2019t find a long-term fix that would solve the team\\u2019s problems.\\nDubas wasn\\u2019t interested in rentals or short-term fixes when he believes their issue on defense is not a short-term problem. Dubas said he received calls about defenseman Tyson Barrie, but didn\\u2019t get what he needed back as part of the return. As a result, he didn\\u2019t move him and has risked losing him for nothing in free agency.\\nOf course, many will argue Dubas created his own problems in this area by signing so many expensive contracts at forward and that he\\u2019ll try to fix those problems by spending more over the summer as the salary cap increases.\\nRelated: Top 3 All-Time Capitals Goalies\\nJets to Spend Money In Free Agency?\\nSpeaking of cap increases, Mike McIntyre of the Winnipeg Free Press writes that the projected salary cap increase for next year will entice teams to spend a little more and one of those teams could be the Winnipeg Jets.\\nJets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff to go shopping with an extra $4-$6 million to spend and with the termination of Dustin Byfuglien\\u2019s contract likely during the summer, the Jets could have as much as $22 million in available funds. Obviously, the Jets have some internal housekeeping items to look after, such as re-signing Jack Roslovic, Mason Appleton, Jansen Harkins, and Sami Niku.\\nRelated: Winnipeg Jets Jersey History\\nDoughty Struggling With Kings Re-Build\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard, but it\\u2019s the position I\\u2019m in, and I gotta try to stay positive every day, as hard as it is,\\u201d Drew Doughty told TSN when asked about the Los Angeles Kings current rebuild, He likes the prospects in the pipeline, but Doughty says it\\u2019s often a struggle knowing where they were as a team not just a few short years ago.\\n\\u201cI have to make the best of it and just try to get better every day, both as a team and individually,\\u201d he added.\\nCoronavirus Update for the NHL\\nThere are many in the NHL starting to think the coronavirus issue is going to be a major issue that affects games, meetings and other events related to North American sports, including the NHL. So far, 36 events worldwide have been affected.\\nHealth officials had actually already requested that the San Jose Sharks cancel Thursday\\u2019s game and Sharks Sports and Entertainment issued a statement in which it said it was \\u201caware of the recommendations\\u201d made by the county, but that Thursday night\\u2019s game against the Minnesota Wild would \\u201cgo on as scheduled.\\u201d\\nCommissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL has barred League employees from overseas business travel and advised the media that those who make personal trips to affected countries must be quarantined out of the office for two weeks upon their return to see if symptoms arise.\\nRight now, the virus hasn\\u2019t hit the games yet, but the NHL is keeping an extremely close eye on things.\\nCatch up on all the latest NHL Rumors\",\n          \"Idea Crib\\u2019s Well-thy Pinoy Profiles blog series is now underway!! With this blog series, I plan to regularly feature healthy and happy Pinoys and glean insights about why and how they keep healthy and happy. The ultimate aim is to inspire more individuals to take care of themselves by taking care of their health and their bodies.\\nThe first featured personality in this blog series is my friend Carlo, a marathoner and Certified Investment Solicitor. He also just finished his first triathlon last week. Check out his answers in the blog\\u2019s latest post.\\nWell-thy Pinoy Profiles: Get to Know Carlo Sicat\\nOccupation Senior Financial Adviser & Certified Investment Solicitor\\nHobbies Triathlon, Ultimate Frisbee, and Backpack Traveling\\nSocial media profile IG: @carlokohan\\nHow do you stay healthy?\\nI stay healthy by making sure I do physical activities daily or every other day. I also make sure that I eat right and in moderation.\\nWhy do you keep healthy?\\nIt feels good to be healthy. It boosts your confidence and it also gives you benefits like not being sick and being able to function well in your job.\\nWhen did you decide to live healthy?\\nI used to work in the BPO Industry. As we all know, the nature of BPO work is kind of exhausting due to shifting schedules; I gained a lot of weight while working in a BPO company.\\nI used to be a fan of fast food. I loved eating in buffet and indulging in sweets. I thought that as long as I was earning good, I can eat whatever I want. Until I frequently got sick. I remember getting hospitalized 3x a year due to gastritis. I was obese by then. I thought I was healthy because I looked healthy but I wasn\\u2019t. That was when I decided to lose weight.\\nI tried running thinking that was the fastest way to lose weight. It proved effective for me. I learned to love it and it eventually became part of my routine.\\nWhat are your favorite indulgences/ cheat day treats?\\nIce cream. I can finish a 1.5 gallon in one seating. My favorite flavor is cookies and cream. Buffets. I still can\\u2019t resist them. Tenka at Glorietta 4 is my favorite so far.\\nIn your opinion, what\\u2019s the one thing people can do to kick-start their journey to wellness?\\nDid you know that eating healthy, doing physical activities, and not smoking are the 3 easy behaviors we can do to not get sick? According to studies, if we take these for granted, these may lead to the top 4 chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and lung diseases which contribute to 50% of deaths world wide. You don\\u2019t have to be an athlete or a gym rat. Just make sure you stay active, eat healthy, and quit smoking (if you\\u2019re a smoker, that is) because the only person who will take care of the sick person you will be is the healthy you now.\\nI love that last line. Soo true. I also agree that you don\\u2019t have to be an athlete to be healthy! What can you say about Carlo\\u2019s journey to fitness and wellness? Who else can I feature in this series? I\\u2019d love to hear your comments below.\\nThe next Well-thy Pinoy Profile is on March 30, 2016.

However, once we’re finished with the eating, we need to water it all down, and we usually do it with a soda or some other unhealthy drink. Well, we really ought to change that, and we believe that the best replacement for an unhealthy drink is a healthy drink – a healthy smoothie. That is why we are going to tell you how to make a healthy breakfast smoothie; in order to be healthy, and eat healthier and tastier.\n",
            "First of all, in order to make a smoothie, you’ll need to know what ingredients to have. Well, for this particular smoothie, you don’t need much. You’ll need 1 banana, 2 tablespoons of muesli, 2 tablespoons of yogurt, and 3 apples. We can all agree that this is something that most of us can find without any fuss.\n",
            "The first thing we ought to do when it comes to preparing the drink is to slice and chop up the apples. Then, we need to make a juice of them and put that juice in a blender. Then, we also need to cut the banana into several smaller pieces, because, let’s face it, a whole banana won’t help us much. Then, after we’re done with the slicing of the banana, we should put those slices in the blender as well.\n",
            "Once we’re done with the slicing, we ought to mix up the muesli and yogurt. Now, some people like muesli more and some like it less, and it is up to us to decide how much of it we ought to add to the mix. But, it is advised to stick to the measurements mentioned here. Then, once we’ve mixed the muesli and yogurt together, we need to pour it into the blender, together with all the other ingredients that are already there.\n",
            "Then, we ought to turn on the blender, and blend the ingredients for about 20 seconds (or at least until you see that everything is blended together perfectly). And, that’s it; you’ve successfully made a healthy smoothie that you can drink with your breakfast. You can make be sure that you’re drinking something that is perfectly healthy, and that with this smoothie, the most important meal of the day will definitely keep you vibrant and energetic enough to get through the rest of the day.\n",

            "Document: Over the weekend, the Washington Post's Mike Wise wrote a column about Wizards point guard John Wall's recent encouraging play. For whatever reason, this made former superagent David Falk very mad, mad enough to call up Wise and go on a tirade against Wall and the Wizards organization. Lucky for us, Wise used his conversation with Falk to write a highly entertaining follow-up column in which Falk comes off like a salty old man. Some highlights:\n",
            "\"I'm going to save you from embarrassment,\" Michael Jordan's former agent said as an introduction Monday night when he called.\n",
            "A Wizards season ticket holder, Falk added: \"You guys are in dreamland. Because this team [stinks] so bad you guys want John Wall to be someone he will never be.\"\n",
            "\"Let me ask you a question,\" Falk said, maybe 28 times over 30 minutes, often answering for you. \"Who's bigger, Kyrie Irving or John Wall? John Wall. Who's a better athlete? John Wall. Who's faster? Who's stronger? John Wall.\n",
            "\"Now, who's a better player? Kyrie Irving,\" he said of Cleveland's all-star point guard who was rookie of the year in 2012. \"John Wall will never be good as Kyrie Irving was in his first week in the NBA.\n",
            "\"I don't think he'll be a much smarter player,\" he said. \"You can't become a smart player. You either are or you aren't.\"\n",
            "As Wise points out in his column, it is very strange for an active agent to take such blatant shots at a current player, nevermind the fact that writing off a 22-year-old player who has John Wall's athletic gifts is aggressively shortsighted.\n",
            "So what's Falk's deal? He's certainly not the power player he once was when he and Michael Jordan and Nike conquered the sports world together, but why take his frustration out on John Wall? Wise guesses that Falk might hold a grudge against Wall because he was picked ahead of Evan Turner, a client of Falk's, in the 2010 draft.\n",
            "Either way, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind David Falk that John Wall is in fact very good at basketball.\n",

            "series. Discuss after the jump.\n",
            "My feelings on Brand are pretty simple. I feel confident he is and will continue to be a pretty efficient scorer in the half court. His old man moves get the job done and a worthwhile coach will be able to squeeze a decent amount of scoring out of him.\n",
            "I'm praying he figures out to rebound again, but I'm not very hopeful. The thing that troubles me most about Brand is I can't figure out exactly why his rebounding was so pitiful this past season. On one hand, it could've been due to a deterioration of physical skills. On the other hand, he could've just checked out early on and decided not to give the extra effort. I'm not sure which is more damning. The same two possibilities exist for his putrid defense on the pick-and-roll.\n",
            "Some of the blame for both weaknesses can probably fall on Eddie Jordan. Brand played a ton of minutes out of position at the five. He was also one of the many players constantly rotating either to make up for shoddy perimeter defense by Lou, Willie and Iverson or just because that's the type of defense Jordan and his guru Ayers devised. The combination of those two factors certainly didn't help, but that doesn't explain the whole problem away.\n",
            "Going forward, I'm praying a new coach can light a fire under Brand and at least make him an average rebounder. If what we saw this season is all we're going to see, the Sixers are either going to have bite the bullet and drop Brand way down in the rotation, or they're going to sink with him. I really don't want to have to choose between two weak rebounding options at the four for the next two-plus years, and make no mistake, Brand will be here for at least two more seasons if he keeps playing like this.\n",

            "Document: Learning how to build your business is hard work. Not only are you starting from the ground up—creating ideas, reaching out to clients, branding, and developing a website—but as a new business owner you also have a myriad of other responsibilities, too. Running multiple social media accounts, meeting with clients, and developing partnerships with other brands are just a few of your new daily tasks, and it’s easy to get overwhelmed. Not to mention if you’re low on funds, struggling to make ends meet, or unable to find sponsors to back your ideas—then your challenges are even bigger!\n",
            "As you begin to build your business, there are a few things to keep in mind: organizing yourself and your to-do list, finding the best ways to market your products and services, keeping up with trends and sales tactics, and, of course, keeping yourself sane (which might be harder than you anticipated!) at least at the start.\n",
            "Even if you’re starting in a difficult place—face it, most beginning businesses are—you don’t have to throw your dreams out the window. There are ways to build your business, even when you’re low on funds. This list will give you the tools and tips to do so.\n",
            "1. Start with your skills.\n",
            "If you’re looking to build your business, you’re obviously passionate about something. Regardless of your field of expertise, or what you want to build the company around, there’s a talent you have: capitalize on it.\n",
            "Are you a people person? Start calling or reaching out to people in your network to back or share about your ideas. Great with design? Create a logo and branding copy for your company. Excellent at SEO? Start creating articles that you can have on hand to share when you’re running low on content.\n",
            "When you tap into your inherent skills, you’ll find it’s much easier to build your business when you start with what you know, first.\n",
            "2. Collaborate and create partnerships.\n",
            "So maybe you’re low on funds—that doesn’t mean you can’t advertise, market, and work with other companies and people to share about your business! One of the easiest ways to build your business is to reach out to other people and offer collaborations or co-marketing instead of paid advertising.\n",
            "For example, reach out to other influencers/social media gurus in your career field and ask them to re-share a link from your website for a share on your page in return. Offer to write or create something for free that points people on your social media to theirs, with the promise of them tagging you on a social media post, etc. These are just a few examples, but there are countless ways to work your advertising angle and collaborate/co-market without spending a dime.\n",
            "3. Use your network.\n",
            "This is similar to collaborating, but it’s more about reaching out and connecting with people in your network than creating partnerships or co-advertising opportunities. Think of this as just tapping into people from your past to create a connection. This connection might not translate to a sale, or even anything completely beneficial, but you never know who this person might know, or recommend your services to.\n",
            "Tap into people from previous jobs, schools, or even places you’ve lived. Share about your business, ask for recommendations, and even offer them a friendly discount, if applicable if they share or help you market in some way. Again, this doesn’t have to translate to a direct sale, but it’s making those simple connections that will drive your business forward.\n",
            "4. Launch a discount or promo to drive sales.\n",
            "When you’re low on funding, the last thing you want to do is run a sale, but it might be one of the best ideas. People get excited about discounts and opportunities where they feel like they’re getting something for less. To get people learning and connected to your new business, launch a sale or promo. You might also consider making it an exclusive deal: based on time, number of people, etc. so there’s even more of a push to purchase/sign up/get connected.\n",
            "5. Search for interns or people wanting experience.\n",
            "In over your head? Don’t feel like you need to hire someone and shell out your precious cash! Instead, tap into job boards or networks where people are offering services for free. Search for interns looking to build their resumes. Inquire about college students eager to put their classroom learning into work. Even consider a work-for-trade program.\n",
            "6. Capitalize on what funds you do have.\n",
            "If you’re thinking about investing in your business, set aside some funds that are considered ‘untouchable.’ This meaning you won’t spend them on anything other than business-related expenses, no matter what. Consider opening a business bank account, too, so that you can better manage your money. And be sure to only spend on what’s absolutely necessary, being conscious of what you can wait to purchase versus what needs to be paid for right now.\n",
            "7. Reach out for sponsors.\n",
            "If you think your business might be a good fit for a certain company, or if you want to advertise for a bigger brand and in turn having them sponsor you, then by all means! Research, seek out, and contact people and businesses. Sponsorships are a great way to get your feet off the ground when you’re low on funds.\n",
            "8.Take out a business loan.\n",
            "So maybe you’re struggling right now—but you won’t always be! If you’re in a tough place, but know you’ll eventually be able to drive enough sales to make a solid income, consider taking out a small business loan. This can help you tremendously! Just remember to keep tabs on the interest, payments, etc. so you don’t run into any issues later.\n",
            "Last but not least, when you’re low on funds and want to build your business, the best advice is to simply hustle. Work hard, keep yourself motivated, and capitalize on the hours you do have. Don’t stress yourself out or wear yourself too thin, but don’t slack, either. You can do this!\n",

        "Classifier Effectiveness: The classifier performs reasonably well, with an F1 score of 0.6012, suggesting it is fairly effective at distinguishing between useful training data and non-relevant documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Composition: The dataset contains documents that were manually labeled based on a model's prediction of whether they contain structured steps for task completion or reasoning. This curated nature of the dataset means that the results should be viewed with caution. If the dataset has biases or ambiguities, they will directly influence the classifier’s performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Generalization to FineWeb: The classifier's performance on the test set might not fully generalize to the entire FineWeb dataset, as the model's predictions were based on the curated labels. The diversity of topics and document structures within the broader FineWeb could lead to performance drops. Therefore, while it may be reasonable to apply the classifier to the FineWeb data, the results should be carefully monitored, and further tuning or evaluation on a more representative dataset might be needed.\n",

        "The dataset we used is derived from FineWeb, and the labels were generated by a GPT-4o-mini model, which was likely trained to identify \"step-by-step\" procedural documents and those that might aid in deeper reasoning. This means the composition of the dataset is already somewhat curated.\n",

        "Consequences for Results:\n",
        "Label Quality: The labels given by GPT-4o-mini serve as a gold standard, but they may not be perfect. Since the model was tasked with making binary judgments (Yes/No), there may be some ambiguity in documents that don’t clearly fit one category.\n",
        "Class Imbalance: The distribution of \"Yes\" and \"No\" for the \"Training\" and \"Step-by-step\" labels might not be balanced. If one category (e.g., \"Yes\") is underrepresented, the classifier might be biased toward predicting the majority class.\n",
        "Data Bias: Since GPT-4o-mini likely used pre-existing data patterns to decide on the labels, it might have biased the dataset towards certain types of procedural documents or reasoning-heavy articles. This could affect the generalization ability of the classifier."

        "This project aimed to train a classifier to detect documents containing step-by-step instructions useful for training reasoning models using a dataset of 2,515 web articles. The model used was based on BERT, fine-tuned on the \"Training\" label (Yes/No) of the dataset. The performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. After training, manual inspection of the model’s predictions revealed that while the model performed fairly well, certain challenges related to data quality and imbalances in labels impacted the results.\n",

        "The model occasionally confused documents that contain procedural instructions but might not have been detailed enough for deeper reasoning.\n",

        "Future Steps:\n",

        "Further fine-tuning with additional data to improve recall and precision.\n",
        "Addressing potential data imbalance and exploring more complex models (e.g., ensemble methods) could enhance the results.\n",
        "The project demonstrates that the classifier is useful for identifying well-structured instructional documents but would require more work to generalize across a broader set of web content."
